📊 Sentiment-Driven Crypto Trading Analysis
This project explores the intersection of market sentiment and cryptocurrency trading performance using real-world datasets. By merging historical trading data with the Fear & Greed Index, the analysis uncovers behavioral patterns and profitability trends under varying emotional market conditions.

🔍 Key Features:
Data Integration: Combined two datasets—trader performance and sentiment scores—on a daily basis to enable joint analysis.

Sentiment Mapping: Translated qualitative sentiment labels into numeric scores for correlation and visualization.

PnL Insights: Assessed how trader profits (Closed PnL) vary across sentiment regimes using statistical summaries and visualizations.

Behavioral Patterns: Analyzed trade side distributions (Buy/Sell) and account-level performance shifts between Fear and Greed periods.

Correlation Study: Investigated the relationship between sentiment intensity and trading outcomes using scatterplots and statistical metrics.

📈 Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab

CSV-based data ingestion and preprocessing

💡 Outcome:
The project reveals that while sentiment does influence trading volume and behavior, its correlation with profitability is weak—suggesting that emotional market cues may not be reliable predictors of success. These insights can inform more resilient trading strategies and behavioral finance studies.
